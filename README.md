## React Blog with Tailwind CSS and Typed.js
This is a blog application built with React.js, styled using Tailwind CSS, and enhanced with animated text using Typed.js.

## Features
1. React.js: The application is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for reusable and modular code, making it easy to maintain and scale the application.

2. Tailwind CSS: The blog is styled using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind CSS provides a set of pre-defined utility classes that can be easily combined to create custom and responsive designs. It offers flexibility and helps in maintaining consistent styling throughout the application.

3. Typed.js: The blog utilizes Typed.js, a JavaScript library for creating typewriter-like animated text. This adds a visually appealing and interactive element to the blog by animating the text content dynamically. The Typed.js library allows for customization of typing speed, backspacing, and looping effects.
